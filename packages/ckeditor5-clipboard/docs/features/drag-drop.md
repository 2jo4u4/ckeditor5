## Installation

<info-box info>
	This feature is required by the clipboard plugin and is enabled by default in all official builds. These installation instructions are for developers interested in building their own custom rich-text editor.
</info-box>

To add this feature to your rich-text editor, install the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard) package:

```
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard
```

Then add the {@link module:clipboard/clipboard~Clipboard `Clipboard`} plugin to your plugin list:

```js
import Clipboard from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard/src/clipboard';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ Clipboard, Bold, ... ]
	} )
	.then( ... )
	.catch( ... );
```

The {@link module:clipboard/dragdrop~DragDrop `DragDrop`} plugin will activate along with the clipboard plugin.
